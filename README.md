# About

This is Bastion's modifcation of Devin's Badges! Devin's Badges is a project for adding neat, consistent badges to your repository, website, and many others! A modification of the official website will come soon, you'll have to be a bit pacient...

## How to use

Want to add these badges to your page? Head over to the [badge reference](https://intergrav.github.io/devins-badges-docs/badges/) to find the badges most fitting for your use, and how to use them. You can then copy the HTML code, which I recommend for best customizability, or the Markdown code for your chosen badge, and paste that into your file.

## Adding more badge types

If you want a new badge type to this project, you'll have to download Figma. But don't worry, all the necessary features to add a new badge are free! It takes just a few seconds to learn, so why not head over to the [Figma website](https://www.figma.com/)? The badge template can be found [here](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/v3/other/devinsbadges-template.fig).
